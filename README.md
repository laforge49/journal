Bill's Technical Journal

Created using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)

## A journal

As I keep starting new projects, and as I have learned the value of separating commentary from code, I've decided to have a project which is just a journal. There may be code snippets as well, but little more.

Hopefully this will give rise to greater continuity.

## Daily Notes

Each day I create a new daily note. Well, some days anyway. The daily note has two parts. The first part is the journal entry for that day, though most days have no such entry.

## Topics

The second part of the daily note is the set of topics that I've added or changed.  This way older versions are not altered.

The topic files are then just indexes to all the versions for each topic. Easy enough then to see how a topic has evolved. The latest version for each topic can be found by following the last link in the index.
