## A journal

As I keep starting new projects, and as I have learned the value of separating commentary from code, I've decided to have a project which is just a journal. There may be code snippets as well, but little more.

Hopefully this will give rise to greater continuity.

## Topics

With each passing day I can revise topics written on previous days by adding the updated version to the note for the day. This way older versions are not altered.

Each topic note then contains links to all the versions of a topic. Easy enough then to see how a topic has evolved.

Topics are simply indexes into the journals. The latest version for each topic can be found by following the last link in the index.


See [Contents](Contents.md) for a suggested reading order.
