I've left behind earlier work on interchanges and instead have been focused on async processing and federations. But interchanges are more critical while async processing and federations add considerable complexity.

So I'm dropping async processing and federations. Indeed, I'm already in the process of dropping federations. Emphasis then is on interchanges as well as internal form of filesys. There are enough changes since I last worked on interchanges, like dropping most uniqueness requirements to support in-memory versioning.
