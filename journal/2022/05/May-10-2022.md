How does a system develop over time?

1. Generate the initial system from a minimal set of configuration data.
2. Add and embellish on the generated system. Alternatively, revert to an earlier generated system and modify that.
3. Regenerate a new version of the system, adding default values, required substructures and internal linkages.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 as required.

I call this a regenerative system. It gets even more interesting when the system is self-reflexive, where the meaning of various constructs within the data are also defined there and can be changed as needed. And this is what we are setting about to define. The name of this the Gems Framework.
