## Introduction
[index](../../Topic%20Indexes/Introduction.md)

Knowledge structures, it seems to me, should be at the heart of any large and complex system. We need a Integrated Development System (IDE) for building and maintaining knowledge structures and for creating payloads for configuring derivative systems that make various uses of those knowledge structures.

## Regenerative Systems
[index](../../Topic%20Indexes/Regenerative%20Systems.md)

How is a knowledge structure developed over time? It can be developed manually, but for a large structure we need a system which will perform consistency checks, provide default data where it is needed, provide required substructures and internal linkages. In other words, everything that can be automated should be automated.

1. Generate the initial knowledge structure from a minimal set of configuration data.
2. Add and embellish on the that knowledge structure. Alternatively, revert to an earlier generated knowledge structure and modify that.
3. Regenerate a new version of the knowledge structure, performing consistency checks, adding default values, required substructures and internal linkages, etc.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 as required.

I call this a regenerative system. It gets even more interesting when the structures are self-reflexive, where the meaning of various constructs within the structure are also defined there and can be changed as needed. And this is what we are setting about to define. This is an IDE for maintaining knowledge structures. We call it the Gems Framework.
