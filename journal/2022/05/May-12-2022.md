[Contents](../../Contents.md)

Tired of having to go through an index to see a topic. But instead of changing everything, I'm going to use a mixed system where the index for [Contents](../../Contents.md) remains (but bumped up a level) along with all existing indexes. But those indexes (other than Contents) will no longer be updated.

Instead, in the case of an updated topic, Context will link to the updated version of the topic. New versions of a topic then will carry either a link to the index for older versions or a prior link to the prior version of the topic.

Migration then will be incremental.
