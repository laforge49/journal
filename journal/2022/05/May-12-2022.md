[Contents](../../Contents.md)

Tired of having to go through an index to see a topic. But instead of changing everything, I'm going to use a mixed system where the index for [Contents](../../Contents.md) remains (but bumped up a level) along with all existing indexes. But those indexes (other than Contents) will no longer be updated.

Instead, in the case of an updated topic, Context will link to the updated version of the topic. New versions of a topic then will carry either a link to the index for older versions or a prior link to the prior version of the topic.

Migration then will be incremental.

## Introduction
[index](../../Older%20Topic%20Indexes/Introduction.md)

Knowledge structures, it seems to me, should be at the heart of any large and complex system. We need a Integrated Development System (IDE) for building and maintaining knowledge structures and for creating payloads for configuring derivative systems that make various uses of those knowledge structures.

 We are setting about to define an IDE for maintaining knowledge structures. We call it the Gems Framework.
