## Introduction
[index](../../Topics/Introduction.md)

How does a system develop over time?

1. Generate the initial system from a minimal set of configuration data.
2. Add and embellish on the generated system. Alternatively, revert to an earlier generated system and modify that.
3. Regenerate a new version of the system, adding default values, required substructures and internal linkages.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 as required.

I call this a regenerative system. It gets even more interesting when the system is self-reflexive, where the meaning of various constructs within the data are also defined there and can be changed as needed. And this is what we are setting about to define. The name of this the Gems Framework.

## Gems Framework
[index](../../Topics/Gems%20Framework.md)

The gems framework is a regenerative and self-reflexive system. The primary structure is called a [Gem](../../Topics/Gems.md). Gems are able to operate asynchronously, each active gem having its own light-weight thread.

Data within a gem is organized into facets, where each facet has its own access rules and behaviors.

Gems are themselves organized into [Namespaces](../../Topics/Namespaces.md), which are in turn partitioned into [Applications](../../Topics/Applications.md).

## Applications
[index](../04/April-25-2022.md)

The [Gems Framework](../../Topics/Gems%20Framework.md) supports multiple applications, each of which is fully independent from all the others. Applications my be derived from other applications, but the contents of a new application are copied from other applications. Updates to an application then has no impact on any other application--they are fully decoupled.

## Namespaces
[index](../../Topics/Namespaces.md)

A namespace is a versioned collection of gems within a single [application](../../Topics/Applications.md). Each gem is held by a single namespace version. When a new version of a namespace is created, new gems are created or copied from an older version of the namespace. Copies of gems and namespaces may also be made across applications.

Namespaces are organized hierarchically within an application, with each level supporting multiple versions. This hierarchical structure is used to copy groups of namespaces from one application to another.
