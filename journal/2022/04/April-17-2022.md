## Env
[index](../../Topics/Env.md)

I like the idea of having a single persistent map, env, with different values accessible at different point in the code. Env is not global, but passed as a parameter from function to function. At any point the env map can be updated, but its value is never returned.

Data can be shared using env by adding atoms to env. Two threads with different versions of env which contain the same atom will both access the same content of that atom.

Now you may want to limit the scope of the data being shared, or even share different data in different scopes. This is achieved by deleting or replacing an atom held by the env map. Shared data then may, or may not be, global.

## Named Go Blocks
[index](../../Dropped%20Topics/Named%20Go%20Blocks.md)

Go blocks are light weight threads which pass messages via channels. Named go blocks then are go blocks which process messages from channels that reside in a shared map, each go block having its own input channel.

And this shared map? Why, put it in an atom that resides in the [Env](../../Topics/Env.md) map.
