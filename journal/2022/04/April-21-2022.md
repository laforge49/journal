## A Singular API
[index](../../Older%20Topic%20Indexes/A%20Singular%20API.md)

We can create a singular uniform API simply by loading all the arguments needed by a function into the [Env](../../Older%20Topic%20Indexes/Env.md) and then passing that version of env to the function.  

This gives us a great deal of flexibility in how arguments are passed. For example, if func1 calls func with an augmented version of the env passed to func1, then when can add additional arguments to func2 and pass them when we call func1 without having to modify the code for func1.

## Function Handles
[index](../../Older%20Topic%20Indexes/Function%20Handles.md)

A function handle is a string which names a function. It takes the form ns:fn, where fn is the name of the function and ns is its namespace. 

Function handles are invoked as follows:

```clojure
((resolve (apply symbol (str/split function-handle #":"))) env)
```
