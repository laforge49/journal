## Function Handles Table
[index](../../Topics/Function%20Handles%20Table.md)

Quite often we need to name an operation whose implementation differs from one [gem](../../Topics/Gems.md) to the next. This is easily achieved using a level of indirectness. Every gem has a function handles table, which maps operation names to function handles.

The function handles table is located in the [Gem Local Data](../../Topics/Gem%20Local%20Data.md).

## Requirements of an Operation
[index](../../Topics/Requirements%20of%20an%20Operation.md)

An operation is an [env](../../Topics/Env.md) with the following contents:

- The atom holding the named go blocks. This is included in every env and is used to send env to the selected go block.
- The name of the gem. This name is used to select the channel used to send the env.
- The operation name. This name is used to identify the [function handle](../../Topics/Function%20Handles.md) in the gem's [function handles table](../../Topics/Function%20Handles%20Table.md), which is then invoked.
- Any additional data needed when calling the function identified by the function handle.
