## Function Handles Table
[index](../../Topics/Function%20Handles%20Table.md)

Quite often we need to name an operation whose implementation differs from one [gem](../../Topics/Gems.md) to the next. This is easily achieved using a level of indirectness. Every gem has a function handles table, which maps operation names to function handles.

The function handles table is located in the [Gem Local Data](../../Topics/Gem%20Local%20Data.md).
