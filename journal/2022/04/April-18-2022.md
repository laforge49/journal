With each passing day I can revise topics written on previous days by adding the updated version to the note for the day. This way older versions are not altered.

Each topic note then contains links to all the versions of a topic. Easy enough then to see how a topic has evolved.

## Gems
[index](../../Topics/Gems.md)

Gems are a building block of an asynchronous framework. Gems are persistent maps and the entries in those maps are called facets.

Every gem has an associated go block, i.e. a light-weight thread, for processing the requests sent to that gem. And one facet of every gem holds the channel to which those requests are sent.

Gems are in turn held by a shared persistent map, where the keys are the names of the gems. And this shared map? It is in an atom that resides in the [Env](../../Topics/Env.md) map.

## Named Go Blocks
[index](../../Dropped%20Topics/Named%20Go%20Blocks.md)

Replaced by Gems.

## Gem Local Data
[index](../../Topics/Gem%20Local%20Data.md)

Gem local data is data held by the local variables in a gem's go block. Gem local data is private to the go block and is not included in the facets of a gem.

In contrast, when a gem's go block is initialized, it is given an [env](../../Topics/Env.md) which contains both the atom holding the map of all gems and the name of the gem associated with that go block.
