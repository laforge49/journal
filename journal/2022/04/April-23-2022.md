- The atom holding the named go blocks. This is included in every env and is used to send env to the selected go block.
- The name of the gem. This name is used to select the channel used to send the env.
- The operation name. This name is used to identify the [function handle](../../Topics/Function%20Handles.md) in the gem's [function handles table](../../Topics/Function%20Handles%20Table.md), which is then invoked.

- Any additional data needed when calling the function
