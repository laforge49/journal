## Requirements of an Operation
[index](../../Topic%20Indexes/Requirements%20of%20an%20Operation.md)

An operation is an [env](../../Topic%20Indexes/Env.md) with the following contents:

- The atom holding the named go blocks. This is included in every env and is used to send env to the selected go block.
- The name of the gem. This name is used to select the channel used to send the env.
- The operation name. This name is used to identify the [function handle](../../Topic%20Indexes/Function%20Handles.md) in the gem's [function handles table](../../Topic%20Indexes/Function%20Handles%20Table.md), which is then invoked.
- The completion channel. This channel is set to true to signal the normal completion of the function, or set to the exception thrown by the function. The channel is created when the function is invoked and then to synchronize with the completion of that function.
- Any additional data needed when calling the function.

## Vector of Operations
[index](../../Topic%20Indexes/Vector%20of%20Operations.md)

A vector of operations is simply a vector of [Envs](../../Topic%20Indexes/Env.md) which meet the [requirements of an operation](../../Topic%20Indexes/Requirements%20of%20an%20Operation.md). The intention of a vector of operations is to define a series of operations which can be executed successively, one after another.

Note that the completion channel is added to each env as it is invoked and the sequencer then waits for a response on that channel before throwing the returned exception or invoking the next env in the series.
