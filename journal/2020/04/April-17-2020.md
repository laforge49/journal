# A journal

As I keep starting new projects, and as I have learned the value of separating commentary from code, I've decided to have a project which is just a journal. There may be code snippets as well, but little more.

Hopefully this will give rise to greater continuity.

## Env

I like the idea of having a single persistent map, with different values accessible at different point in the code.
